## Conference Papers

**Optimizing Graph Traversal Algorithms for Low-Power Embedded Controllers**  
*Undergraduate Research Symposium 2024*  
**Myrick Wang**, Dr. Supervisor Name  

*Abstract*: This paper explores memory-efficient implementations of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms on constrained architectures like the Cortex-M0+. We demonstrate a **30% reduction in SRAM usage** compared to standard C++ STL implementations by utilizing bit-field representations for visited sets.

## Technical Reports

**Stability Analysis of Feedback Loops in Adaptive Lighting Systems**  
*Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol*  
Jan 2024  

**Summary**: A detailed analysis of the Bode plot and phase margin for the automatic lamp post control loop. The report establishes the theoretical limits of gain to ensure system stability under varying environmental noise conditions, verified through LTSpice simulations and physical bench testing.

## Works in Progress

**Resilience of Scale-Free Networks against Targeted Attacks**  
*Independent Research*  
Expected completion: Dec 2024

Investigating the percolation threshold of scale-free networks when high-degree nodes are systematically removed. Current simulations suggest a sharp phase transition in connectivity that correlates with the power-law exponent of the degree distribution.
