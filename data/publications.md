## Conference Papers

### Optimizing Graph Traversal Algorithms for Low-Power Embedded Controllers
**Myrick Wang**, Dr. Supervisor Name
*Undergraduate Research Symposium 2024*

**Abstract**
This paper explores memory-efficient implementations of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms on constrained architectures like the Cortex-M0+. We demonstrate a **30% reduction in SRAM usage** compared to standard C++ STL implementations by utilizing bit-field representations for visited sets and iterative deepening strategies.

## Technical Reports

### Stability Analysis of Feedback Loops in Adaptive Lighting Systems
*Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol (2024)*

A detailed analysis of the Bode plot and phase margin for automatic lamp post control loops. The report establishes theoretical gain limits to ensure system stability under varying environmental noise conditions, verified through LTSpice simulations and physical bench testing.

## Works in Progress

### Resilience of Scale-Free Networks against Targeted Attacks
*Independent Research (Expected Dec 2024)*

Investigating the percolation threshold of scale-free networks when high-degree nodes (hubs) are systematically removed. Current simulations suggest a sharp phase transition in connectivity that correlates with the power-law exponent of the degree distribution. This research has implications for designing robust power grids and communication infrastructure.
